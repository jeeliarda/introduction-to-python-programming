Before We Install Python:
1. Prepare to Use Command Line
recommend to reinforce Unix Shell commands: Shell Workshop | Udacity
2. Is Python Already Installed On Your Computer?
In this course, we're using the most recent major version of Python - Python 3

Mac OS X and Linux usually come with Python 2 already installed. We DO NOT recommend that you make any changes to this Python, since parts of the operating system are using Python

we can type commands in terminal to check whether python is installed

python --version'''
