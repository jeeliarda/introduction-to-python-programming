'''While Loops
For loops are an example of "definite iteration" meaning that the loop's body is run a predefined number of times.
"indefinite iteration" which is when a loop repeats an unknown number of times and ends when some condition is met, which is what happens in a while loop.'''
card_deck = [4, 11, 8, 5, 13, 2, 8, 10]
hand = []

# adds the last element of the card_deck list to the hand list
# until the values in hand add up to 17 or more
while sum(hand) < 17:
    hand.append(card_deck.pop())
    print(sum(hand))

print(hand)

output:

'''The indented body of the loop should modify at least one variable in the test condition.
If the value of the test condition never changes, the result is an infinite loop!

'''L4-23. Quiz: While Loops
Quiz: Nearest Square
Write a while loop that finds the largest square number less than an integer limit and stores it in a variable nearest_square. A square number is the product of an integer multiplied by itself, for example 36 is a square number because it equals 6*6.

For example, if limit is 40, your code should set the nearest_square to 36.

my answer:'''

limit = 40

# write your while loop here

root = 1
nearest_square = 0
square = root**2
while (square < limit):
    nearest_square = square
    root += 1
    square = root**2

print(nearest_square)

#solution:

limit = 40

num = 0 # start from 0
while (num+1)**2 < limit: # +1 is the key point
    num += 1
nearest_square = num**2

print(nearest_square)
